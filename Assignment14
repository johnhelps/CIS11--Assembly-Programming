Assignment14

 Which assignment took you the longest to complete?
 The first assignment.
 Which assignment was the most difficult?
 Assignment 11
 Which assignment was the easiest?
 The binary assignments.
 Of the concepts we covered, which (if any) are you the most confused about still?
 Understanding the conversion of 32 bit to 64 bit. Your powerpoints helped a lot! 
 If we had an extra week to spend on any of the concepts covered in this course, which one would it be?
 Stack frames.
 Were there any assignments you felt were unnecessarily tedious (not necessarily difficult, but that took too long to complete)
 Assignment 1.
 Which assignment was your favorite?
 Assignment 8.
 Which assignment do you think you learned the most from?
 Assignments 11 - 13.
 Were the assignment requirements and due dates clear enough? If not, how so?
 Yes, but an actual confirmed date to turn in everything would be amazing besides a 2 week turn in period (I believe you said the last day to turn in everything revised is the 26th of May).
 On a scale of 1-5, rate the difficulty (1=Breating, 5=Exiting Vim) of this course compared to other CIS courses you've taken.
 3.
 Was the book used in this course effective/helpful? Would you recommend a different one?
 Used a lot + the internet!
 Were there any topics that we didn't cover that you would have liked to see included?
 64 bit conversion! Since the book is focused on 32 bit.
 How can this course be improved?
 By having a building project to code in robots with MASM to fight off the other team's bots, and be victorious!
 Nothing but coding MASM in class, with in class examples. A lot of hands on.
